# Calibrating the `OG-Core` model

As noted in the introduction, the `OG-Core` model must be parametrized to represent a specific country. We refer to the process of finding parameter values that represent a specific economy as "calibration".  Because data sources for country-specific data differ, there's not a single way to calibrate all economies. We have therefor have created country-specific calibration packages.   Some examples of these include the [United States](https://github.com/PSLmodels/OG-USA), the [United Kingdom](https://github.com/PSLmodels/OG-UK), [South Africa](https://github.com/EAPD-DRB/OG-ZAF), [India](https://github.com/Revenue-Academy/OG-IND), and [Malaysia](https://github.com/Revenue-Academy/OG-MYS).

In this chapter, we describe the process of creating a country-specific calibration and provide exercises related to certain components of that calibration.  We will use as an example the calibration of `OG-Core` to South Africa, in the [`OG-ZAF`](https://github.com/EAPD-DRB/OG-ZAF) package.
